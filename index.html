                    <p>
                        My coding journey began with a curiosity about how websites and apps work. Exploring HTML, CSS,
                        and JavaScript, I realized frontend development's power in shaping user-tech interaction,
                        blending design with function.
                        <br /><br />
                        Through online courses and projects, I mastered responsive design, ensuring seamless experiences
                        across devices. I delved into CSS animations, adding intuitive delight.
                        <br /><br />
                        Collaborating with designers and backend devs, I bridge creativity and functionality. Thriving
                        in teamwork, I value open communication for crafting exceptional digital solutions.
                        <br /><br />
                        Stepping into frontend, I'm eager to learn, create captivating interfaces, and embrace emerging
                        tech. Recently, I've been entrusted with the opportunity to immerse myself in the OutSystems Low-Code
                        Platform, marking an exciting new chapter in my coding journey.
                        Beyond coding, I enjoy writing, music, film analysis, motivation, and swimming.
